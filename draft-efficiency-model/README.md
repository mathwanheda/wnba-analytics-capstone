# Draft Efficiency Model – Predicting WNBA Rookie Success

This project builds a statistical model to evaluate how well NCAA performance metrics predict rookie outcomes in the WNBA. By exploring multivariable regressions, positional segmentation, and draft value, this project aims to uncover trends that can support smarter draft strategy.

## Key Questions
- Which NCAA stats are most predictive of WNBA rookie success?
- Do guards and post players follow different development curves?
- Can we quantify value over draft slot?

## Advanced Features
- Multivariate regressions with interaction terms
- Position-specific models
- “Draft Value Added” score: performance vs. expected based on pick

## Draft Classes Analyzed
- 2022, 2023, 2024 WNBA Draft classes

## Metrics Used
- NCAA: PER, TS%, AST/TO, 3PT%, Usage, REB%
- WNBA: PER, Win Shares, MPG, Rookie Efficiency Tier

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, sklearn, seaborn)
- Excel for tiering + exploration
- Tableau (optional comparative visuals)

## Output
Model insights, regression visualizations, and a framework for evaluating draft efficiency—applicable to front office analytics.
