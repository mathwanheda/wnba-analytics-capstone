# Shot Chart Comparison – NCAA vs. WNBA

This project explores how shot selection, efficiency, and spatial tendencies evolve when elite women’s basketball players transition from the NCAA to the WNBA.

## Key Questions
- Do players maintain the same shot profile at the pro level?
- Are certain college shot zones predictive of WNBA success?
- How does game pace or defensive pressure affect shooting zones?

## Advanced Goals
- Zone-based eFG% comparisons
- Tempo-adjusted volume charts
- Cluster analysis based on shot profiles

## Players Analyzed
- Caitlin Clark
- Paige Bueckers
- Rickea Jackson
- Arike Ogunbowale (as a vet comparison)

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Tableau (for polished visuals)
- GitHub for version control

## Output
A visual and statistical breakdown of how shot patterns shift across levels—with implications for scouting and player development.
