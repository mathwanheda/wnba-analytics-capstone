## Pick 9: If Paige Bueckers Is Off the Board (Expected)

**Status:** Bueckers is expected to go #1 overall to Dallas in most mock drafts.

**Impact on Sparks Strategy:**  
With Bueckers unavailable, the Sparks should shift focus from primary ball-handlers to versatile wings or interior contributors who fit around Kelsey Plum.

## Pick 9: Ideal Scenario

**Target:** [Kiki Iriafen](../scouting/kiki_iriafen.md) (Big – USC)  
**Rationale:** Interior scorer with rebounding and post skill. Provides size, physicality, and frontcourt versatility. Can play next to Hamby or as a small-ball 5.  
**Key Fit Score Traits:**  
- High Help Defense IQ  
- Usage: ~22–24%  
- Strong rebounding and finishing metrics

1. [Sonia Citron](../scouting/sonia_citron.md) (Wing – Notre Dame)  
   - Polished off-ball scorer with high IQ and two-way potential  
   - Great fit as a low-usage 3-and-D connector  

2. [Temira Poindexter](../scouting/temira_poindexter.md) (Wing – Tulsa)  
   - Athletic, floor-spacing forward with shot-blocking upside  
   - High-impact swing defender who stretches the floor

**Best Guard Fit:** [Serena Sundell](../scouting/serena_sundell.md) – Low usage, high AST/TO, smart team defender  
**Best Wing Fit:** [Sonia Citron](../scouting/sonia_citron.md) – Spot-up shooting + defensive IQ

## Trade-Down Scenario (Pick ~15–18)

If the Sparks trade down, here are high-fit depth targets based on role and score:

- [Sarah Ashlee Barker](../scouting/sarah_ashlee_barker.md) (Wing)  
  Two-way wing with gritty defense and secondary playmaking

- [Makayla Timpson](../scouting/makayla_timpson.md) (Big)

### Best Available Fits at Pick 21

  Athletic rim-runner with shot-blocking instincts. High Fit Score as a low-usage paint defender.

- [Serena Sundell](../scouting/serena_sundell.md) (Guard – Kansas State)  
  Low-usage combo guard with high AST/TO and strong help defense. Could stabilize second-unit lineups.

### Value Priorities in the Second Round

| Role Type              | Target Example                  | Fit Rationale |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| 3-and-D Wing           | Madison Scott, Sarah Barker     | Low usage, defensive motor |
| Stretch Big            | Temira Poindexter, Sania Feagin | Floor spacing or rim deterrence |
| Connector Guard        | Serena Sundell                  | Smart, low-maintenance playmaking |
| Hustle/Glue Player     | Madison Scott                   | Fills gaps, doesn’t need touches |

## Third Round: Pick 28 Targets

While few third-rounders make opening-day rosters, the Sparks can use this pick to add depth, camp competition, or a developmental specialist. The Fit Score Matrix still highlights players with translatable traits and clear team fit.

### Best Available Fits at Pick 28

- [Aicha Coulibaly](../scouting/aicha_coulibaly.md) (Wing – Auburn)  
  Physical slashing wing who defends with intensity. Not a floor spacer, but brings athleticism and toughness.

- [Dazia Lawrence](../scouting/dazia_lawrence.md) (Wing – Charlotte)  
  On-ball shot creator with mid-range scoring ability. Developing defender who could thrive in a bench scoring role.

- [Maddy Westbeld](../scouting/maddy_westbeld.md) (Big – Notre Dame)  
  Stretch-capable big with high feel and rebounding motor. Good passer for her position. Lateral quickness a question.

- [Aaliyah Nye](../scouting/aaliyah_nye.md) (Wing – Illinois)  
  Catch-and-shoot wing with confident range. Limited creation, but potential 3-and-D rotation player with development.

---

### Third-Round Value Indicators

At this stage, the matrix helps identify:
- Players with **one standout skill** (e.g. spacing, motor, defense)
- Wings and bigs who **don’t need the ball**
- Players who **contribute through system fit** rather than star potential

Ideal third-round profiles:  
- Low-usage scorers  
- Defensive-minded wings  
- High-IQ forwards with rebounding instincts
