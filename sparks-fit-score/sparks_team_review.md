|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| New York Liberty     | Top 1 (Elite)           | Top 3                    |
| Minnesota Lynx       | Top 3                   | 2nd                      |
| Connecticut Sun      | Top 5                   | Top 3                    |

**Interpretation:** The Sparks need to improve offensive efficiency by ~5–7 points per 100 possessions and defensive efficiency by ~4–6 points to compete at a playoff level.

## Roster Usage & Role Gaps (Highlights)
- Heavy reliance on Hamby and Jackson for scoring and rebounding
- Guard rotation inconsistent and injury-prone
- Brink’s injury exposed depth issues in the frontcourt
- Wing rotation lacked scoring and spacing

## Roster Outlook

- Cameron Brink is expected to return from her ACL tear in 2025, bringing back elite rim protection and rebounding potential.
- Nneka Ogwumike’s contract status remains unresolved. If she departs, it leaves a major leadership and frontcourt scoring gap.
- Kelsey Plum joins the Sparks via a blockbuster trade, adding elite-level scoring, playmaking, and late-game execution to the backcourt.
- Mercedes Russell signed as a free agent, providing reliable frontcourt depth and veteran experience as a backup center.
- Shaneice Swain, a 2023 draftee, will join the team in 2025, adding international guard depth and scoring upside.
- Lexie Brown, Kia Nurse, Zia Cooke, and Li Yueru have departed, opening up new depth concerns—particularly at the wing.

## Draft Strategy Focus

With the backcourt now led by Kelsey Plum and Aari McDonald, the Sparks no longer need to prioritize a lead guard in the first round. Instead, they should focus on:
- Forward and wing versatility to stabilize rotations
- Rebounding and interior defense to support Brink and Russell
- High-IQ, low-usage players who can contribute efficiently in smaller roles
- Defensive length and switchability to anchor a playoff-caliber defense
