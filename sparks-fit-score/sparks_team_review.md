- Heavy reliance on Hamby and Jackson for scoring and rebounding
- Guard rotation inconsistent and injury-prone
- Brink’s injury exposed depth issues in the frontcourt
- Wing rotation lacked scoring and spacing

## Roster Outlook
- Cameron Brink expected to return from ACL tear in 2025
- Nneka Ogwumike’s status remains uncertain; her departure would create a major frontcourt void
- PG/SG depth and consistent shooting remain concerns

## Draft Needs Summary
| Position           | Traits Needed                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Backup Point Guard | Ball handling, AST/TO ratio, 3PT range        |
| Scoring Wing       | Shot creation, perimeter shooting, versatility|
| Stretch Forward    | Rebounding, rim protection, mobility          |
| Defensive Guard    | Multi-positional defense, quickness           |

## Draft Strategy Focus
Target players who can make an immediate impact on both ends, especially those who bring rebounding, playmaking, or shot-making. Prioritize high-IQ, low-turnover prospects with versatility and defensive reliability.
