## Benchmarking vs. Top Teams

| Team              | Offensive Rating | Defensive Rating |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| New York Liberty  | Top 1 (Elite)    | Top 3            |
| Minnesota Lynx    | Top 3            | 2nd              |
| Connecticut Sun   | Top 5            | Top 3            |
| LA Sparks (2024)  | 98.6             | 107.7            |

_To reach playoff competitiveness, the Sparks need to improve offensive efficiency by 5–7 points per 100 possessions and reduce defensive rating by 4–6 points._

## Roster Usage & Role Gaps

- **Heavy reliance** on Hamby and Jackson for scoring/rebounding
- **Inconsistent guard rotation** with injuries and role instability
- **Brink’s ACL injury** left the frontcourt thin defensively
- **Wing rotation lacked** reliable scoring and 3PT spacing

---

## Roster Outlook (Pre-Draft 2025)

- **Cameron Brink** returns in 2025, bringing elite rim protection
- **Nneka Ogwumike** has departed, creating a PF scoring + leadership void
- **Kelsey Plum** arrives via trade to anchor backcourt scoring and creation
- **Mercedes Russell** signs as a frontcourt backup
- **Shaneice Swain** joins from the 2023 draft class as a developmental guard
- **Departures**: Lexie Brown, Kia Nurse, Zia Cooke, Li Yueru

_Depth concerns persist at forward and wing, with open minutes at the 4 and off-ball defense rotation gaps._

## Draft Strategy Focus

With Kelsey Plum and Aari McDonald in place, the Sparks should shift away from lead guards and toward rotation stabilizers who bring:

- **Forward and wing versatility** to fill positional gaps
- **Rebounding and interior defense** to protect Brink and Russell
- **Low-usage, high-IQ players** who excel in complementary roles
- **Defensive length and switchability** for late-game flexibility
