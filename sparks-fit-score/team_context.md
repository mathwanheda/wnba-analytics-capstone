# Los Angeles Sparks: Team Context & Draft Philosophy

This page outlines how the 2024–2025 Sparks roster, offseason moves, and long-term direction influenced the structure and weighting of the Fit Score Matrix.

## 2025 Roster Overview

Heading into the 2025 Draft, the Sparks roster is anchored by:

### Guards
- **Kelsey Plum** (acquired via trade from Las Vegas)  
- **Odyssey Sims** (re-signed)  
- **Julie Allemand**, **Shaneice Swain** (depth + development)  
- **Aari McDonald** (RFA offer extended)

*Departures*: Zia Cooke, Layshia Clarendon

**Backcourt Summary**: Well-stocked. High-usage guards are deprioritized in favor of defenders, low-turnover ball movers, and off-ball glue guards.

---

### Wings
- **Rae Burrell**, **Kia Nurse**  
- **Training Camp Additions**: Maria Kliundikova, Anneli Maley

**Wing Summary**: Still no true 3-and-D starter. Perimeter defense, spacing, and switchability are top priorities. This positional gap heavily influenced Fit Score weightings.

---

### Forwards / Bigs
- **Dearica Hamby**, **Azurá Stevens** (both signed to extensions)  
- **Mercedes Russell** (free agent signing)  
- **Emma Cannon**, **Li Yueru** (camp + reserve)

*Departures*: Queen Egbo, Monique Billings

**Frontcourt Summary**: Functional core, but limited depth. Ideal prospects are low-usage bigs who rebound, defend, and don’t need touches to contribute.

## Offseason Transactions That Shaped Draft Needs

Key roster events informing this draft model:

- **Kelsey Plum trade** → deprioritize on-ball creators  
- **Odyssey Sims return** → no need for scoring-first guards  
- **Nneka Ogwumike departure (to SEA)** → need a new two-way 4  
- **Mercedes Russell signed** → adds size but not spacing  
- **Waived players**: Zia Cooke, Queen Egbo, Clarendon → openings for low-usage wings and bigs

## Draft Priorities & Fit Profile

The Fit Score Matrix was built to highlight players who offer:

| Trait                    | Why It Matters for Sparks |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Wing Defense / Switchability** | Needed to fill the void left by Nneka + no true SF on roster |
| **Low Usage, High Impact**       | Complementary roles next to Plum, Hamby, Stevens |
| **Spacing + Versatility**        | Floor balance and flexible lineups |
| **Defensive Rebounding**         | Help side anchors, second-unit rebounding |

## How This Influenced the Fit Score Matrix

To reflect the Sparks' unique structure, the matrix weighted:

- **Defense** heavily: block/steal %, defensive rating, Help IQ  
- **Role fit**: Usage rate, AST/TO, off-ball impact  
- **Spacing + gravity**: 3PT%, 3PAr  
- **Secondary creation**: selectively weighted for guards/wings

High-usage guards and isolation scorers were de-emphasized unless they brought elite defense or passing value.

## Draft Strategy Summary

The Sparks are not looking for ball-dominant stars — they’re looking for players who:

- Defend  
- Rebound  
- Space the floor  
- Fill roles without needing volume

This context drives every simulation, ranking, and scouting report in this project — delivering a model that's team-specific, role-aware, and roster-aligned.
