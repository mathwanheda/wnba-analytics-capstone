# Rayah Marshall — Big

## Summary

Elite defender with exceptional shot-blocking instincts and rebounding ability. Marshall impacts the game without needing the ball, using her length and timing to anchor the paint. Offensively limited but efficient as a cutter and lob target.

## Projected WNBA Role

Defensive specialist and rotation big. High-ceiling anchor for bench units or closing lineups that prioritize rim protection.

## Fit with the Sparks

Marshall fits a major Sparks need for interior defense and low-usage frontcourt play. Her shot-blocking and help-side instincts boost team defense, especially alongside mobile forwards or stretch bigs.
