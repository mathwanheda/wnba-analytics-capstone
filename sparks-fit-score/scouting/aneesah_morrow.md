# Aneesah Morrow — Big

## Summary

Highly productive forward with strong rebounding, scoring, and physicality. Morrow thrives in the paint but has shown signs of expanding her perimeter game. Excellent motor and toughness.

## Projected WNBA Role

Starter upside as a physical big. Ideal for systems that emphasize rebounding and post scoring with some face-up skill.

## Fit with the Sparks

Though slightly more usage-heavy than ideal, Morrow’s rebounding and toughness address key Sparks needs. Her versatility as a scorer may create mismatches off the bench or in hybrid lineups.
