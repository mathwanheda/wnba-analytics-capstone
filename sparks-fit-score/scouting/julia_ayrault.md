# Julia Ayrault — Wing

## Summary

Versatile 3-and-D forward who defends multiple positions and contributes in transition. Ayrault has strong rebounding instincts, a reliable spot-up jumper, and the agility to guard both wings and bigs. Offensively, she thrives off-ball with cutting and spacing.

## Projected WNBA Role

Rotational wing defender and connective piece. Ideal for switching systems or teams seeking defensive versatility without sacrificing floor spacing.

## Fit with the Sparks

Ayrault’s size, low usage, and defensive versatility address key Sparks roster needs. Her rebounding and cutting complement high-usage guards like Plum, and she can slot in across multiple lineups as a defensive glue player.
