# Paige Bueckers — Guard

## Summary

Elite playmaker and shot creator with proven scoring efficiency at high usage. Bueckers excels in the pick-and-roll, with advanced feel, shooting touch, and vision. She brings consistent defensive effort and above-average positional rebounding for her size. Her high IQ and leadership traits further strengthen her profile as a WNBA-ready guard.

## Projected WNBA Role

Starter-level combo guard with primary or secondary creation duties. Offensively skilled enough to lead bench units or close games, especially in a system that values ball movement and off-ball relocation.

## Fit with the Sparks

While Bueckers has a high Fit Score, her on-ball usage may slightly overlap with Kelsey Plum. However, her off-ball versatility, defensive instincts, and efficient shooting still make her a strong value play. She offers plug-and-play upside in dual-guard lineups.
