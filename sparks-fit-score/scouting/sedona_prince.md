# Sedona Prince — Big

## Summary

Efficient interior scorer with size and rim protection. Prince has a soft touch around the rim and offers shot-blocking on defense. Not a floor spacer, but a capable anchor in drop coverage and post sets.

## Projected WNBA Role

Rotation center. Low-usage, high-efficiency big with rim deterrence and paint presence.

## Fit with the Sparks
