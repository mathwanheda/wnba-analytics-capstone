# Sparks Fit Score â€“ 2025 Draft Prospect Matching

This project evaluates 2025 NCAA WNBA Draft prospects based on their statistical and strategic fit with the **Los Angeles Sparks**. Using a weighted scoring model, roster-based trait prioritization, and contextual scouting, it builds a ranked shortlist for Picks #9, #21, and #27.

## Key Questions

- What traits and positions do the Sparks most need to address in the 2025 draft?
- Which NCAA prospects best align with those needsâ€”statistically and contextually?
- Can we create a **repeatable scoring model** to assist in team-specific draft decisions?

## How the Fit Score Works

Each prospect is evaluated across core metrics:

- **3PT %**
- **Assist-to-Turnover Ratio**
- **Defensive Rating / DREB %**
- **Usage Rate / TS %**
- **Positional Versatility**
- **Help Defense IQ** *(qualitative)*
- **Secondary Playmaking** *(qualitative)*

Each trait is:
- **Weighted by position** (Guard, Wing, Big)
- **Normalized to a 0â€“100 scale**
- Aggregated into an **Overall Fit Score** and **2-Way Impact Score**

Prospects are ranked into tiers: `Top Target`, `Strong Fit`, or `Depth Option`.
