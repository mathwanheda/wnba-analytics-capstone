# Sparks Fit Score – 2025 Draft Prospect Matching

This project evaluates 2025 NCAA draft prospects based on their statistical and strategic fit with the Los Angeles Sparks. It combines trait-based scoring, roster gap analysis, and data-driven scouting to build a ranked shortlist for Pick #9.

## Key Questions
- What skills do the Sparks most need to address in the 2025 draft?
- Which NCAA players best fit those needs statistically?
- Can we create a repeatable model for prospect scoring?

## Advanced Features
- Weighted scoring matrix by team need (e.g. 3PT%, AST/TO, defensive metrics)
- Z-score comparisons vs. WNBA positional averages
- Mock draft volatility insights

## Prospects Evaluated
- Georgia Amoore
- Te-Hina Paopao
- Aneesah Morrow
- Aaliyah Edwards
- Kamilla Cardoso

## Tools Used
- Excel (scoring matrix)
- Python (radar charts, Z-score plots)
- Tableau (interactive comparisons)

## Output
A visual and statistical scouting board + fit scores for Sparks’ top targets, with implications for draft-night decisions and roster construction strategy.
